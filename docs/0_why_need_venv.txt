Why we need to Python Virtual Environment?
Virtual environment is a python module/package which allows us to segregate project dependencies and avoid conflicts.

Lets say we have python3.9 installed on your laptop, and you have created a python project and it uses Py-Mongo:2.1
And you have created another python project on the same laptop and this project requires Py-Mongo:3.6.
This causes conflict as python interpreter can install one version of a module on the same laptop. This is
resolved by python virtual environment.

So we use venv to create isolate environment for python projects and it will not affect any other environment,
using it we can install any python package with any version and its completely isolated to this project.



python3 -m venv <virtual env name>
python3 -m venv venv

A venv folder will be created under src folder, and inside venv/bin/python3.10 will be considered as python
interpreter for this project.

Enable Venv When using VSCODE:
Step1 : open command palet in VSCODE and search for interpreter and select "Enter interpreter path"
Step2: Provide relative path to python in venv folder (./venv/bin/python)
Step3: Open VSCODE terminal and execute below command to enable venv for terminal.
        $ source venv/bin/activate
NOTE: If we close the terminal then we need to run step3 again, if the vscode is closed and opened again make sure
vscode points to venv.
