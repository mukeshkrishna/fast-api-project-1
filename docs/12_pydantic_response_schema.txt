There can be situations like the client should not be knowing all the data from the DB, like the creds etc
as tbey already know it.

So we need to define the response schema.
When returning response, we need to convert sqlachemy model to python dictionary.
Example: we can pass the reponse model in the decorator.
@app.post("/posts", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED,response_model=schemas.Post)
