Let say we want to know the users who created this post, but based on the current setup we cannot
achieve it because there is no relationship between users and posts databases. And the post is not
associated with the user.

We associate posts table with a new column called user_id and this column is created as foreign-key.
Foreign-key is way to tell SQL that this column is connected to another table.

This is called one-to-many relationship in SQL.
Ie, 1 user can create as many posts as they want. But a post will be associated to only 1 user.

We can create relationships in the sqlachemay models, this tells sql-alchemy to fetch certain data
based of the relationships.

in shemas.py, we can refer another pydantic module using the class name.

example: owner: UsersOut ==> UsersOut is a another pydantic model

class UsersOut(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    id: int
    created_at: datetime
    class Config:
        orm_mode = True

class Post(PostBase):
    id: int
    created_at: datetime
    owner_id: int
    owner: UsersOut
    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
