We need to have environmental variables to store certain sensitive information on the machine where the
API/server will be running, by doing so we don't need to hard-code the values in the code.

In an Application or project grows, we might use a lot of environmental variables, and we need to have a mechanism
to check whether all the environmental variables needed by the application are present.
We can use pydantic in validate all the environment variables of their type.

NOTE:
1. any value read using environmental variables will be a string.
2. All environment variable names should be all capital letters. (Best practise)
