Voting and Like System Requirements:
------------------------------------
1. Users should be able to like a post
2. A user should only be able to like a post once
3. Retrieving post should also fetch the total number of likes.

Vote Model:
----------
1. Column to reference post_id and column to reference the user who liked the post as user_id
2. A user should only be able to like a post once, so this means we need to ensure every post_id/user_id
is a unique combination.

To achieve this, we need to make use of composite keys.

What is composite keys:
-----------------------
1. Composite key is nothing but a primary key that spaces multiple columns
2. Since primary keys must be unique, this will ensure no user can like a post twice.
3. The composite keys see a combination of both post_id and user_id to have a unique value.
ie both post_id and user_id is a primary key


Vote Route:
----------

1. Path will be /vote
2. the user-id will be extracted from the JWT token
3. The body will contain the id of the post the user is voting on as well as the direction of the vote.
{
    post_id: 123,
    vote_dir: 0
}
4. A vote direction of 1 means, we want to add the vote. if the direction is 0 means we want to delete a vote.
