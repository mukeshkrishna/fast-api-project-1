GET VS POST:
------------

GET --> We request data from the API server, and server responds with the requested data.
POST --> We use POST request to create data, and we can pass the data to be created, and server responds
with the data it should respond back. Example: store a user in database


How to send body(data block) in POST api?
We can use Body from fastapi.params module/package.

@app.post("/createposts")
def create_posts(payload: dict = Body(...)):
    print(payload)
    return {"message": "Successfully created posts"}
