CRUD OPERATIONS:
----------------

C - Create   --   POST          /post              -- @app.post("/posts")

R - Read     --   GET           /posts/:id         -- @app.get("/posts/{id}")
             |
             ---- GET           /posts             -- @app.get("/posts")

U - Update   --   PUT/PATCH     /posts/:id         -- @app.put("/posts{id}")

D - Delete   --   DELETE        /posts/:id         -- @app.delete("/posts/{id}")


Any application should be able to perform CRUD operations, we should always name the route operations in
plurals(example: /posts and not /post)

For updating the data, PUT or PATCH. But one difference is if PUT call, we need to set all the fields with
correct values. Incase of PATCH we can send only the specific field which needs to be changed.


NOTE: /posts/:id  ; the path parameters will be always returned as a string. in our case it was "id"


Q, Lets say we have 2 routes "/posts/{id}" and "/posts/latest" in this order. If we do get on "/posts/latest"
what will happen?
Ans: it will throw an error as "id" is looking for int and we got "latest" which is string. This is because
order does matter in path operation.

Current order in the main.py:
/posts/{id}
/posts/latest

Proposed order which will fix this:
/posts/latest
/posts/{id}
