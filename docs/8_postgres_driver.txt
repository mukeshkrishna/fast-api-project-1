If we are working with postgres using python, then we need to have a postgres driver.

psycopg 2 --> module to use in python to connect with postgres.

Step 1: Create a connection to postgres using dbname, user etc
Step 2: Open a cursor to perform database operations. we can "execute"( run SQL commands), to save data to
        database as persistent, then we can use "commit".
Step 3: close the cursor, and close the database connection.
