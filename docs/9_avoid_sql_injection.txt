Why to do the below ?
The best way to insert data into SQL is to pass the values separately and not to perform string interpolation
with {}.
cursor.execute("""INSERT INTO posts (title,content,published) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)""",
          (post.title,post.content,post.published))

If we perform the below then we can cause SQL injection, if someone try to pass SQL queries in place of post.tile
or any other fields.
cursor.execute("""INSERT INTO posts (title,content,published) VALUES ({post.title}, {post.content}, {post.published})""")

we are using postgres client library like psycopg2, which can sanatize the inputs if we pass the values separately
as a second field in the execute function.
cursor.execute("""INSERT INTO posts (title,content,published) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)""",
          (post.title,post.content,post.published))


1, Issue faced when passing vars to cursor.execute() function we need to pass a tuple or list?
I passed below, (str(id)) was not considered as a tuple even though i have enclosed it in "()".
cursor.execute("""SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = %s""", (str(id)))
To make it a tuple i need to add a extra comma at the end, like (str(id),). And this fixed the issue.
cursor.execute("""SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = %s""", (str(id),))
